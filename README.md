# Lifen Devops Challenge

 Looking for a job? Check out our [open positions](https://honestica.welcomekit.co/).

## Guidelines

- clone this repo (do **not** fork it)
- solve the levels in ascending order
- commit your code at the end of each level
- once you are done, ping someone from Lifen (ideally via our jobs page)

You can have a look at the higher levels, but please do the **simplest thing** that could work for the level you're currently solving.

Disclaimer: the levels become more complex over time, so you will probably have to re-use some code and adapt it to the new requirements.
Don't hesitate to write [shameless code](http://red-badger.com/blog/2014/08/20/i-spent-3-days-with-sandi-metz-heres-what-i-learned/) at first, and then refactor it in the next levels.

For higher levels we are interested in seeing code that is:
- maintainable
- idempotent
- secure
